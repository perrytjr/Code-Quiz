I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser using HTML, CSS, powered by JavaScript. 

## How it functions

Try to answer the following code-related questions within the time
        limit. Keep in mind that incorrect answers will
        penalize your score time by ten seconds! 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
